### Project Overview

 You have been hired by 'CACT'(Census Analysis and Collection Team) to help with your numpy programming skills. Your major work for today involves census record management and data analysis.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you will have a better grip on working with numpy. In this project, you will apply the following concepts:

Array Appending
Array Slicing
Array Filtering
Array Aggregation


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The various attributes and properties of NumPy arrays are exploited and used to serve the purpose of data analysing in this project.


### Challenges faced

 This project required effecient grouping an extraction of the required data from the main collection of census, to operate on only those data which needed to be analysed.
